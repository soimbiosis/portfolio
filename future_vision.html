									<p>Quarantine has had me sewing, and I think the pandemic has us all thinking: what’s next? And yes, there are many interpretations of that question. What will tomorrow bring? How will this change our healthcare system? What does the future hold for us as a society, as employees, as children, parents, individuals? As I sat with my seam ripper, having sewed the wrong sides of my fabric together for the umpteenth time, I found myself wondering: will this still be someone’s job twenty, fifty, a hundred years from now? Are there factories in The Future?</p>

<p>I have one of those very abstract, tech jobs that didn’t exist fifty years ago. The kind of job where I get a gourmet, hot lunch at work every day, a liveable wage, the flexibility to set my own schedule, and spend most of my days producing nothing tangible. I can’t help but think that one day, the human-powered assembly line will fade gracefully into obsolescence, and this will become the new norm (perhaps minus some of that luxury). We are moving towards a world where simply consuming finite natural resources will not be enough to sustain our growing population. Simultaneously, we are learning more about how Nature creates, and how we too can create additively, with less waste, and symbiotically, with a complete lifecycle in mind. When these two trajectories intersect, I think a new generation of jobs will emerge, along with a cultural shift away from excess, and towards producing exactly what we need, in such a way that what we consume ultimately is returned in some useful form to our environment.</p>

<p>These jobs of The Future are developing even now in remote corners of Academia. Research in the areas of robotic assembly; smart agriculture; customizable, parametric, design; and synthetic biology is well underway, and may well be the future of manufacturing, architecture, and production in general. In The Future, I think all kinds of biologists - botanists, zoologists, geneticists, ecologists - will come together with engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists and designers to create in a way that is complementary and supplementary to Nature. What we consider today to be emerging interdisciplinary fields, especially ones prefixed with ‘bio’ - biofabrication, biogarmentry, bioarchitecture - will be their own distinct disciplines, universally offered college degrees of The Future.</p>

<p>In The Future, you order what you need. Most systems will become customizable, so they can produce exclusively to meet need. You will be able to order clothes to your measurements, furniture to your specifications, and it will be additively manufactured or perhaps even grown with minimal waste. Any assembly will be done by robots. The job of designers will be to design form, new materials, and product lifecycles.</p>

<p>In the world of agriculture, I like to think that monoculture will fall out of favor and permaculture farms, vertical hydroponic gardens, and food forests will be the way of The Future, but alas, I think this lies either in some exceedingly distant future, or is an idealistic thought. I do, however, think that we will be able to do a better job of producing what we need through sensor and model-based smart agriculture, and perhaps even restoring some of our soil quality with the introduction of microbes and some incredibly capable plants.</p> 

<p>And of course, some jobs aren’t going anywhere - at least I hope not. I hope the restaurant industry is here to stay. I don’t see art, music, history, or any of the humanities losing importance in our society anytime soon. I do think that we will see a resurgence of trades and apprenticeships, perhaps coming in to replace jobs like factory work. </p>
