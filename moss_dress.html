							<h1>Moss Dress: Fast Fashion of the Future</h1>
							<h3>Personal Project</h3>
							<p>In the right conditions, moss is ubiquitous. The trees drip with tantalizing tendrils, it coats sidewalks, rooftops, rocks, and walls like a glorious, vibrant green carpet...or a living fabric. It seems, literally, to be able to grow on anything. It requires no soil, and has no roots, only anchoring rhizoids. I was fascinated when I learned this; this project evolved from that fascination. Initially, I just wanted to see if I could get moss to grow onto fabric. But ultimately, my modular moss dress has become something more like a platform for two concepts that challenge us to reimagine our traditional notion of clothing. </p>
							<p>When I began to tell people about my project, most of them asked, "first of all, why? And second of all, how will you keep the moss alive once it's sewn onto the dress?" But one of my coworkers said: <i>"what if part of the point of this clothing was that it decayed on you - that it changed as you were wearing it?"</i></p>
							<p>Why do things we manufacture have to last forever (or at least, long beyond our lifetime), when humans themselves have only a finite lifetime? And in the realm of fashion especially, people almost never buy clothing intending to wear it forever, and trends change seasonally. <i>Why not grow clothes that have a finite lifetime? Clothing with its own lifecycle and lifespan.</i> This is not to say that durability should not be a consideration, but there is a substantial middle ground between plastic, which is created to last more or less forever, and bubbles, which are ephemeral.</p>
							<p>As for the second part of that question, since my Mom simply could not move past the fact that you couldn't wash a dress with moss sewn onto it in the washing machine, I ask: <i>why can't clothing be modular?</i> What if we all wore 'skins' which we accented with pieces that add color, texture, and shape to our look? Constructed another way, the moss accent and perhaps even the bell sleeve could be 'mods' for my 'skin.' And yes, Mom, the 'skins' would be washable.</p>

							<h3>Process</h3>
							<p><b>Design:</b> I love asymmetrical silhouettes. And I wanted the moss to have movement and life, flowing like a river. I then patterned the dress from my bodice, skirt, and sleeve sloper, adjusting the pattern after fitting a 'muslin'.</p>
							<p><b>Construction:</b> The fabric for the dress came from a dress I purchased from Goodwill and deconstructed. The muslin I sewed to adjust the pattern was not actually sewn in muslin, but again, from a deconstructed dress from Goodwill. The dress I patterned did not have a slanted hemline, but I accidentally cut both the front and back fabric from the front dress pattern, and I ended up liking the look of the  slanted hemline that resulted.</p>
							<p><b>Growing Moss:</b> My first few attempts were a total failure. I started with a plastic tub, which with the lid off, dried out far too quickly, and with the lid on, grew mold in a matter of days. I then sewed moss onto scraps of fabric and tried placing one in a passive hydroponic system, one in a 5-gallon jug atop a layer of nutrient-moistened vermiculite, and one outside next to a very mossy rock.</p>
