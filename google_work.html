							<h1>Working at Google</h1>
							<h3>My role</h3>
							<p>I am currently a software engineer on a research and development team working on 3D human capture and rendering. I do a mix of traditional software engineering and exploratory research work, mainly in C++ and Python, with some Cuda GPU programming. At this time, details about our project remain confidential.</p>
							<p>Prior to joining this team, I spent a year on a Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team that manages latency and throughput of Ads serving pipelines. Our software projects were focused on automation of resource allocation, network traffic and data monitoring and management. The other major part of being in SRE was being oncall. While oncall, I was responsible for working with developers to keep live production systems within SLO in real-time.</p>
							<h3>Contributions</h3>
							<p><b>Spacetime Stereo</b>: I worked on quality improvements for the <i>breve</i> descriptor used in <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub47250/">ESPReSSO</a>, a real-time spacetime stereo vision algorithm. The breve descriptor is computed by taking a series of random pixel intensity comparisons in 3x3 windows across 4 time slices, to gather both spatial and temporal information about each pixel in a reference and secondary image. The descriptor itself is binary; if the brightness of pixel a is less than the brightness of pixel b, a bit in the descriptor is set to 1. If the opposite is true, a bit is set to 0. However, when the magnitude of this difference is small, the comparison is less useful in contributing to a fingerprint of sorts for the pixel. The improvement I explored utilized absolute intensity difference thresholds to mark comparisons as reliable or unreliable. The comparisons were then weighted according to their 'reliability' when computing costs between reference and secondary images. I also investigated alternative permability functions.</p> 
							<p><b>Lighting Assessment:</b> Lighting conditions are extremely important in human capture and rendering. Our team developed hardware to measure light flicker and IR spill, and I worked on setting up a data collection process, and analyzing the data to identify problematic lighting environments for human capture. I also analyzed lighting environments for multiple color light sources, lighting color temperature,  lighting directionality, and angular concentration.</p>
							<p><b>Stereo camera position:</b> I conducted studies to determine optimal placement for stereo cameras in a multi-view stereo system.
							<p><b>SWE tasks:</b> My SWE work included contributing to support for 10-bit image data in a system which had previously supported only 8-bit inputs. I also added software support for multiple combinations of IR pattern images for <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub47250/">ESPReSSO</a>.</p>
