							<h1>Project Starline at Google</h1>
							<h3>My role</h3>
							<p>I am currently a software engineer on <a href="https://blog.google/technology/research/project-starline/" target="_blank">Project Starline</a> at Google, where we are conducting research and development in 3D human capture and rendering for the future of communication. I do a mix of traditional software engineering and exploratory computer vision research work. My work is focused on developing novel techniques for identifying and mitigating problematic lighting conditions for human capture. I work mainly in C++ and Python, and have done some Cuda GPU programming as well.</p>
							<p>Prior to joining this team, I spent a year on a Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team that manages latency and throughput of Ads serving pipelines. Our software projects were focused on automation of resource allocation, network traffic and data monitoring and management. The other major part of being in SRE was being oncall. While oncall, I was responsible for working with developers to keep live production systems within SLO in real-time.</p>
							<h3>Contributions</h3>
							<p><b>Spacetime Stereo</b>: I worked on quality improvements for the <i>breve</i> descriptor used in <a href="https://www.danbgoldman.com/misc/espresso/espresso-3dv-2018.pdf" target="_blank">ESPReSSO</a>, a real-time spacetime stereo vision algorithm. The breve descriptor is computed by taking a series of random pixel intensity comparisons in 3x3 windows across 4 time slices, to gather both spatial and temporal information about each pixel in a reference and secondary image. The descriptor itself is binary; if the brightness of pixel 'a' is less than the brightness of pixel 'b', a bit in the descriptor is set to 1. If the opposite is true, a bit is set to 0. However, when the magnitude of this difference is small, the comparison is less useful in contributing to a fingerprint of sorts for the pixel. I explored the idea of weighting comparisons according to their 'reliability' when computing costs between reference and secondary images. I also investigated alternative permability functions, and motion-aware descriptor variants.</p> 
							<p><b>Lighting Assessment:</b> Lighting conditions are extremely important in human capture and rendering. I am working on developing novel techniques to evaluate aesthetic lighting quality and identify problematic dynamic range conditions in the context of human capture. </p>
							<p><b>Stereo camera position:</b> I conducted studies to determine optimal placement for stereo cameras in a multi-view stereo system.
